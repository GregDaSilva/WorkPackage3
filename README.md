This git repository is specifically for the EEE3096S Practical 3.
We are required to program a game that takes in a user's input via a button
and then compares this input the number that is randomly generated by the program.
As the user gets closer, the trigger LED shines at a different brightness and the buzzer sounds at a different frequency.
The scores for each user is stored in the EEPROM which then dispalys the top 3 scores when requested.
